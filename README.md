# Unit2.OddsAndEvents.Starter_eblatz
Workshop - Odds and Events
In this workshop, you'll continue to get more practice working with events and event handlers. The goal is to create an app that allows a user to enter a number which gets placed into a number bank. The user can then sort the numbers in the bank into one of two categories: odd or even.

Instructions
Remember to work on a local cloned copy of your forked repo, and to add your cohort team so that your code can be reviewed!

Read and serve index.html to familiarize yourself with the elements you'll be working with.
Write index.js so that your app meets the requirements below.
Requirements
When the user clicks the "Add Number" button, the number they entered into the input field should be added to the number bank.
The number bank is not changed if the user enters a non-numeric value.
The number bank should display all the numbers the user has entered.
When the "Sort 1" button is clicked, the first number in the number bank should be removed and placed into either the odd or even category.
When the "Sort All" button is clicked, all the numbers in the number bank should be moved into either the odd or even category.
The numbers are placed into the correct bucket based on whether they are odd or even.
Hints
Don't worry about updating the DOM at first! Can you get it working so that the state is correctly updated when the user interacts with the app?
Once you have the state updating correctly, then you can focus on updating the DOM to reflect the state.
Remember to break each problem into smaller subproblems - and ask for help if you're not sure how to do that!
Extensions
If you're done early, try to implement one or more of the following features:

Add a button that generates a random number into the number bank
Refactor the user input field so they can also enter a string of comma-separated numbers
Add a way for users to choose how many numbers they want to sort in addition to just one or all
Sort the numbers not just by odd vs even, but also in ascending order
Add a dropdown that allows users to toggle whether the numbers are sorted in ascending or descending order
Submission
Please submit a link to your Github repo.
